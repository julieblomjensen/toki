          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>LOOPECO approached TÓKI with a clear goal - to create packaging that would reflect their commitment to sustainable beauty while staying true to their minimalist design philosophy.</p>
          <p>As a skincare brand built around responsibility and transparency, they wanted their packaging to speak the same language as their products: clean, honest, and conscious.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <h3>The challenge</h3>
          <p>Most skincare packaging is produced new - designed to look fresh, polished, and untouched. But this approach often leads to excessive waste and overproduction.</p>
          <p>LOOPECO wanted to break that pattern. Their vision was to use existing packaging materials that had already served a purpose elsewhere and give them a new life under the LOOPECO brand.</p>

        <div class="process">
          <h3>The Process</h3>
          <p>Our work began with material exploration. We collected and tested various types of second-hand boxes and labels from local suppliers - each with its own history and imperfections.</p>
          <p>From there, we focused on creating consistency: sanding, refinishing and rebranding each surface to ensure the packaging felt cohesive while still retaining its natural character.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="result">
          <h3>The Result</h3>
          <p>
            The final packaging solution stands as a testament to what thoughtful reuse can achieve. Each box carries subtle marks of its past life - textures and creases that tell a quiet story of transformation. Yet, when arranged together, the
            result feels intentional, elegant, and distinctly LOOPECO.
          </p>
          <p>
            This collaboration became more than a packaging redesign; it became a statement of values. LOOPECO’s customers now receive products that embody the brand’s mission - not just through what’s inside, but through the story told by the box
            itself.
